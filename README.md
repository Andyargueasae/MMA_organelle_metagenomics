# MMA_organelle_metagenomics
The collection of snakemake workflow for MMA metagenomics for recovering chloroplast genomes.

Project implementation commence date: August 8th, 2023

This workflow will try to cover all essential steps in order to get down the genomics-based metagenomic analysis in recovering algal plastidial genomes.

Before starting the new jobs:
1. Set-up the binny workflow, with running ./binny -i config/config.init.yaml
2. Set-up the CAT-taxonomy identification database, for details please see this: https://tbb.bio.uu.nl/bastiaan/CAT_prepare/
3.
