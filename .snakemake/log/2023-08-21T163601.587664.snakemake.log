Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './binnybinny_output' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.

Job 1: Using the machine learning algorithm 'CORGI' to predict contig identity. Don't rise batch size too high.
Reason: Missing output files: output/working/corgi/plastid.fasta

Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.

Error in rule corgi_prediction:
    jobid: 1
    input: ../contigs.fasta
    output: output/working/corgi, output/working/corgi/plastid.fasta
    log: output/logging_info/corgi.log (check log file(s) for error details)

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)
