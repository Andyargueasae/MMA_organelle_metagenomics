MissingOutputException in rule CAT_taxonomy_identification_plus_annotation in file /data/MMA_organelle_metagenomics/Snakefile, line 158:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output2/working/CAT/{params.prefix}.bin2classification.txt
Removing output files of failed job CAT_taxonomy_identification_plus_annotation since they might be corrupted:
output2/working/CAT
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
