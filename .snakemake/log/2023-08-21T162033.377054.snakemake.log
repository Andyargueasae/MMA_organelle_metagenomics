[Mon Aug 21 16:20:33 2023]
Job 0: Using the machine learning algorithm 'CORGI' to predict contig identity.
Reason: Missing output files: output/working/corgi/plastid.fasta, output/logging_info/corgi_benchmarking.tsv

[Mon Aug 21 16:20:48 2023]
Error in rule corgi_prediction:
    jobid: 0
    input: ../contigs.fasta
    output: output/working/corgi, output/working/corgi/plastid.fasta
    log: output/logging_info/corgi.log (check log file(s) for error details)
    conda-env: corgi-env
    shell:
        corgi --file ../contigs.fasta --output-dir output/working/corgi --batch-size 2048 --min-length 350 2> output/logging_info/corgi.log
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job corgi_prediction since they might be corrupted:
output/working/corgi
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
