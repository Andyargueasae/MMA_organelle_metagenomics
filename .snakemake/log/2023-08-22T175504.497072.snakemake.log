Job 2: Use the binning algorithm binny to find all high-coverage bins with completeness>=65% and purity>=90%
Reason: Missing output files: binny/binny_output

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule binny_workflow in file /data/MMA_organelle_metagenomics/Snakefile, line 86:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
binny/binny_output/binny.done
Removing output files of failed job binny_workflow since they might be corrupted:
binny/binny_output
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
