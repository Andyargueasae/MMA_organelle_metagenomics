Job 2: Use the binning algorithm binny to find all high-coverage bins with completeness>=65% and purity>=90%
Reason: Missing output files: binny/binny_output

Waiting at most 10 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule binny_workflow in file /data/MMA_organelle_metagenomics/Snakefile, line 86:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 10 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
binny/binny_output/binny.done
Removing output files of failed job binny_workflow since they might be corrupted:
binny/binny_output
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
